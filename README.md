# pands-problem-sheet

The purpose of this repository is to store the solutions to the Problem Sheet problems.
Solutions for the problems outlined in weeks 2-8 are included. (Please see the requested comments within each solution for further details on the functionality of each solution, as well as research references) 

*Below, I have outlined a short description of the purpose of each program:*


## Week 2 task: BMI Calculator

- A program which calculates a persons Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputted weight(kg) and height(cm).

## Week 3 task: Second String

- A program which takes in a user inputted string and outputs every second letter of that string in reverse order.

## Week 4 task: Collatz

- A program which asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation: At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. The program ends when the current value is one.

## Week 5 task: Weekday

- A program which outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

## Week 6 task: Squareroot

- A program which takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

## Week 7 task: E's

- A program which reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains.

## Week 8 task: Plot task

- A program which displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
